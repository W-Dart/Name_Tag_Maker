This was an ongoing personal project for the University of Wisconsin: Division of Housing Signage Production Shop. It is a React.js web page form that takes employee information and stores in a SQLite database to then be sorted for name tag signage production. This project helped me learn basic SQL commands and Express.js for the backend. The project has not been finished. The last steps would be exporting the sorted data to Excel sheets for the printing hardware.
